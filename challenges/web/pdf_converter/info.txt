Congratulations on pwning the demo challenge! To get the flag, you will need to demo the exploit on the main stage.
To prove that you have successfully pwned the system without leaking the exploit, we will spin up a new instance of the exact same challenge for you.

Prepare an exploit that defaces the website (hint: index.html will be writable in the new instance).
You can deface the website with any content, but keep things safe for work, and do not post offensive material or you would risk disqualification!

Contact @waituck#2607 on discord once you are done!

Once again, congrats on finding the 0-day!
