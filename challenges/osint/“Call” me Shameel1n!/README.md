Author: haojun

# Description

## “Call” me Shameel1n! - A

I was given a post-it note by my boss. She asked me to help her make “calls” to these numbers on behalf of her. She said at the end of it someone will convey something to us. Remember to record it down for her to reference. U the BEST she exclaimed!!!

Instead of actually calling, use the handle name given in this post-it note. Submit the flag as per given.


## “Call” me Shameel1n! - B

You should already have the clue. Hope you will get it :)

Enter the 4 digits passcode without space in between. Submit the flag as per given.


## “Call” me Shameel1n! - C

Now you have the 4 digits passcode, place them back to their original position with space (e.g 1 2 3), with this passcode you will also know my location. Could you identify where I am recording this voicemail?

Submit the building name with the flag format.


# Solution

## “Call” me Shameel1n! - A

Interact with telebot by inputting the correct phone number found on the post-it note which is 645 845 0808.

Flag: `WH2020{YOU_f0und_IT}`

## “Call” me Shameel1n! - B

Then, from here you have a clue to find a phone number starting with 305, so you should be able to identify 305 283 1107.

Also, the voice recording clue, said somehow in this phone number you obtain a 4 digit passcode and more will be revealed.

So if you can infer from the recording, you should sum the digits in each section, and you will get the 4 digits passcode which is 8139.

## “Call” me Shameel1n! - C

Input the passcode in this format 8 13 9 on the google map (there is a reason why), but DON'T press enter after you input, you should be able to find this first location (due to the suggestion algorithmn by google) that contains Shamelin (which relates to the challenge title). 

Drop the human icon dropper, at the pointed location, turn your view around and you will find the building name clearly.
