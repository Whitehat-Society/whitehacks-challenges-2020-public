GPS coordinates is not just the only way to pinpoint a location

# Description

My friend just texted me to meet at this location (caves.flag.towns). But I donâ€™t get it and have been finding this location for hours already. Could you help me out?

Submit the full name of the location with the flag format.
For example, WH2020{Orchard Tower}


# Solution

You should start off with google search such as, 3 word map.

Then, you should see this what3words website.

Input the 3 words given, then you should be able to identify the location very clearly.
